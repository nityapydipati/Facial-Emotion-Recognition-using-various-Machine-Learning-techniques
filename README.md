Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN

Final Project for INF552 at USC. We tried to use several machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forest but the best classification that
worked was Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks).

A dataset of facial images are given with subjects expressing various emotions (Contempt, Neutral, Anger, Happy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Surprise) were split into
training and test sets and ran the model.
